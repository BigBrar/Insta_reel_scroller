⚠️ Why You Should Avoid Them :

❌ Scary & Overstimulating – Sudden noises and bright lights can frighten and overstimulate babies, causing anxiety.

❌ Irritating & Repetitive Sounds – Constant noise can lead to frustration, crankiness, and even affect sleep patterns.

❌ Delays Brain Development – Passive play reduces problem-solving, creativity, and sensory exploration.

❌ Reduces Physical Activity – Babies need hands-on interaction for motor skill development, not just pushing buttons.

❌ Short Attention Span – Self-playing toys entertain but don’t encourage focus, curiosity, or meaningful engagement.

❌ Lack of Social Interaction – Babies learn best through real-world interactions, not from toys that play on their own.

✅ Better Alternatives for Healthy Growth :

🧸 Open-ended Toys – Blocks, soft toys, and wooden puzzles encourage creativity.

📚 Books & Storytime – Reading boosts language and cognitive skills.

🤲 Hands-on Play – Stacking, sorting, and pretend play develop motor and problem-solving skills.

👶 Interactive Play with Parents – Talking, singing, and playing together strengthen emotional bonds and learning.

Pune, Maharashtra","I’m so good at reading people. My gut is almost always right
You look quite good! When I see the video at first I was wondering if it was ia video
Same 👏
I’ve learned letting it play out rather than tell anyone always works the best 🙌🏼🫶🏼
My favorite is when people say “I can’t wait for you to meet so and so, you’re just going to looooove her!”. 99% of the time I don’t. 😂 Sorry but my bs radar has been flashing hard for twenty minutes now and I’m counting down til I can leave.
🙌 Meeeeee. That’s why I avoid most humans at all costs 😂
My intuition never misses!
This is me. And I am right 💯 of the time.
Absolutely! 💯agree 💕I've been in so many similar situations, and it taught me a valuable lesson: trust your instincts. When my intuition signals a lack of connection, I've learned to honor that. While maintaining kindness is paramount, we don't need to cultivate close relationships with everyone.
Sorry I couldn’t read or focus after seeing your gorgeous jacket!
God you're good 😂
😂 this is soo accurate

That feeling when everyone’s like “don’t you just love this person?!” and you’re like 😬🫣

Moral of the story? Learn to listen to your intuition. It often sees a lot more than the eye does and that saves you a lot of headache!

Sometimes, the internet gives us exactly what we didn’t know we needed—like bunnies jumping on a trampoline. Their fluffy bodies bounce like little clouds, each hop a burst of calm energy. It’s not just cute—it’s genuinely relaxing.

With no loud music or distractions, just soft jumps and twitchy ears, this video feels like a deep breath for your brain. Even though it's AI-generated, the charm is real. It reminds us that joy can come from the simplest things—like bouncing bunnies just living their best lives.

They think she needs a boyfriend, but what she really wants is the freedom to explore the world, travel without limits, and find peace in the mountains and nature.

All she needs is to know her worth and realise she doesn’t need anyone to complete her because she’s already happy with who she is. The quiet beauty of the mountains, the calm of untouched places, and the peace that comes from being surrounded by nature are what make her feel alive.

For her, the best adventure is finding calm in the world’s most beautiful spots, where all that matters is the moment. She wants to connect with the earth, feel its peace, and live life in its simplest and purest form, without worrying about others’ expectations.

A relationship isn’t her goal…. freedom, self-growth, and peace are.

A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, triggering a tsunami in the northern Pacific. Warnings were issued from Alaska and Hawaii to New Zealand.

In Honolulu, tsunami sirens prompted evacuations to higher ground.

Japan recorded a 40 cm tsunami on Hokkaido's southern coast.

In Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, near the epicenter, there was structural damage and evacuations, but no major injuries.

The tsunami first hit Severo-Kurilsk in the Kuril Islands; residents remain on elevated ground.

The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center confirmed a tsunami could impact all Hawaiian coastlines.

Authorities continue to monitor for aftershocks and additional waves.

Share this with someone you’d chase waterfalls with ❤️

We hiked for hours in Indonesia — sweaty, laughing till our stomachs hurt, and wondering if we took a wrong turn… *but then we saw this.* And suddenly, every step was worth it.

It’s moments like these that stick. Not the perfect photos, but the tired high-fives, the silence when beauty leaves you speechless, and knowing you’re sharing it with *your* person.

Follow us @wanderinggoofs for more raw travel moments. We’re hunting hidden gems — and goofy love stories — around the world.

📍𝗗𝘂𝗱𝗵𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗿 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 - 𝗚𝗼𝗮🍃👇🏻
ഇന്ത്യയിലെ ഗോവ സംസ്ഥാനത്തിലെ ഒരു വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടമാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം.310 മീറ്റർ [ 1017 അടി ] ഉയരമുള്ള ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം മാണ്ഡവി നദിയിലാണുള്ളത്. ഗോവയുടെ തലസ്ഥാനമായ പനാജിയിൽ നിന്നും 60 കി.മീ അകലെയായാണ് ഈ ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം സ്ഥിതിചെയ്യുന്നത്.

മഴക്കാലത്ത് ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിലേക്കുള്ള പ്രവേശനം താൽക്കാലികമായി നിർത്തി വെക്കാറുണ്ട്. ഒക്ടോബറോടെ പ്രവേശനം അനുവദിക്കും. ഇന്ത്യയിലെതന്നെ ഏറ്റവും മനോഹരമായ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടങ്ങളിൽ ഒന്നാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം.

റോഡുവഴിയും റെയിൽ വഴിയും ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിനരികിൽ എത്തിച്ചേരാൻ സാധിക്കും. കുലേം തീവണ്ടിനിലയമാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗറിനോട് ഏറ്റവും അടുത്തുകിടക്കുന്നത്.

ഏറ്റവും അടുത്തുള്ള റെയിൽവേ സ്റ്റേഷൻ കർണാടകയിലെ ഉത്തര കന്നഡയിലെ കാസിൽ റോക്ക് ആണ്. സന്ദർശകർക്ക് ഇവിടെ നിന്ന് ട്രെയിനിൽ കയറി ദൂദ്സാഗർ സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ ഇറങ്ങാം. സഞ്ചാരികൾക്ക് പ്ലാറ്റ്ഫോം പ്രതീക്ഷിക്കാവുന്ന ഒരു സ്റ്റേഷനല്ല ദൂദ്സാഗർ റെയിൽ സ്റ്റോപ്പ്. യാത്രക്കാരും സന്ദർശകരും റെയിൽ കമ്പാർട്ടുമെൻ്റിൻ്റെ കുത്തനെയുള്ള ഗോവണിയിലൂടെ 1-2 മിനിറ്റ് ഷെഡ്യൂൾ ചെയ്യാത്ത സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ കയറണം.

ഈ റെയിൽ സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ നിന്ന് സന്ദർശകർക്ക് വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിലെത്താൻ ട്രാക്കിലൂടെ ഒരു കിലോമീറ്ററോളം നടക്കണം. 200 മീറ്റർ ട്രെയിൻ ടണലുണ്ട് അത് തികച്ചും ഇരുണ്ടതാണ്.

Exactly how my hubby kisses me. I literally almost passed out one day. He thought: Whoah she's really into it! I can really feel her moving around and getting into it!

Here is how:

I called this method: “ The digital detox “.

Here is how you do it:

Step 1:

Remove ALL your phone notifications.

Step 2:

Don’t bring the phone to your bedroom.

Step 3:

Turn off your phone when you want to study/work.

Step 4:

Unfollow all model and meme accounts.

Step 5:

Create new hobbies to replace social media.

Step 6:

If you aren’t following this account, we will probably never meet again. If you are, congrats, you are growing every day.

उत्तराखंड :
धरती कांपी… और सब कुछ पल में मलबा बन गया।

उत्तरकाशी का खूबसूरत गांव धराली, जो कभी हरी-भरी वादियों में बसा शांत और स्वर्ग सा लगता था, अब तबाही की दर्दनाक तस्वीर बन चुका है।

सिर्फ 1 मिनट से भी कम वक्त में ज़िंदगियाँ उजड़ गईं, घर मिट्टी में मिल गए, और सन्नाटा सब कुछ निगल गया।

तस्वीरें देखकर रूह कांप उठती है…

💔 ये सिर्फ एक गांव नहीं था, ये कई सपनों का घर था।

🙏 आइए मिलकर प्रार्थना करें धराली के लोगों के लिए — और आवाज़ उठाएं ताकि ऐसे इलाकों में सुरक्षा और सहायता समय पर पहुंच सके।

📢 Share करें, ताकि ये संदेश और दर्द हर दिल तक पहुंचे।

A cozy balcony retreat nestled in a lush, misty mountain landscape during a gentle rainfall. The wooden deck, adorned with vibrant orange flowers and green foliage, exudes a warm and inviting atmosphere. A comfortable seating area with plush orange and patterned cushions sits against the wall, accompanied by a wooden coffee table set with a teapot and teacups, suggesting a peaceful tea session amidst nature.

To the right, a well-stocked bookshelf adds an intellectual charm, illuminated by a warm hanging light. The rain-soaked wooden floor enhances the sense of tranquility, while a black metal railing entwined with blooming flowers frames the breathtaking view of rolling mountains covered in mist and dense greenery.

The ambiance is a perfect blend of nature and comfort, offering an ideal space for relaxation, reading, or simply enjoying the sound of rain against the backdrop of a stunning mountain landscape.

There’s something about nights around a campfire that just hits different. The crackle of the flames, the warmth cutting through the cold night, the way conversations get deeper and laughs come easier as the embers burn.

No distractions, no rush, just good company; in our case some special time with family and our three dogs snoozing after a long hike. These nights create the kind of peace you can’t find anywhere else; and here at this two van camp, we are thankful for these special moments 💛

📍𝗗𝘂𝗱𝗵𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗿 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 - 𝗚𝗼𝗮😍👇
ഇന്ത്യയിലെ ഗോവ സംസ്ഥാനത്തിലെ ഒരു വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടമാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം.310 മീറ്റർ [ 1017 അടി ] ഉയരമുള്ള ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം മാണ്ഡവി നദിയിലാണുള്ളത്. ഗോവയുടെ തലസ്ഥാനമായ പനാജിയിൽ നിന്നും 60 കി.മീ അകലെയായാണ് ഈ ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം സ്ഥിതിചെയ്യുന്നത്.

മഴക്കാലത്ത് ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിലേക്കുള്ള പ്രവേശനം താൽക്കാലികമായി നിർത്തി വെക്കാറുണ്ട്. ഒക്ടോബറോടെ പ്രവേശനം അനുവദിക്കും. ഇന്ത്യയിലെതന്നെ ഏറ്റവും മനോഹരമായ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടങ്ങളിൽ ഒന്നാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗർ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടം.

റോഡുവഴിയും റെയിൽ വഴിയും ഈ വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിനരികിൽ എത്തിച്ചേരാൻ സാധിക്കും. കുലേം തീവണ്ടിനിലയമാണ് ദൂധ്സാഗറിനോട് ഏറ്റവും അടുത്തുകിടക്കുന്നത്.

ഏറ്റവും അടുത്തുള്ള റെയിൽവേ സ്റ്റേഷൻ കർണാടകയിലെ ഉത്തര കന്നഡയിലെ കാസിൽ റോക്ക് ആണ്. സന്ദർശകർക്ക് ഇവിടെ നിന്ന് ട്രെയിനിൽ കയറി ദൂദ്സാഗർ സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ ഇറങ്ങാം. സഞ്ചാരികൾക്ക് പ്ലാറ്റ്ഫോം പ്രതീക്ഷിക്കാവുന്ന ഒരു സ്റ്റേഷനല്ല ദൂദ്സാഗർ റെയിൽ സ്റ്റോപ്പ്. യാത്രക്കാരും സന്ദർശകരും റെയിൽ കമ്പാർട്ടുമെൻ്റിൻ്റെ കുത്തനെയുള്ള ഗോവണിയിലൂടെ 1-2 മിനിറ്റ് ഷെഡ്യൂൾ ചെയ്യാത്ത സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ കയറണം.

ഈ റെയിൽ സ്റ്റോപ്പിൽ നിന്ന് സന്ദർശകർക്ക് വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടത്തിലെത്താൻ ട്രാക്കിലൂടെ ഒരു കിലോമീറ്ററോളം നടക്കണം. 200 മീറ്റർ ട്രെയിൻ ടണലുണ്ട് അത് തികച്ചും ഇരുണ്ടതാണ്.

You’re dangerous the moment you stop asking for a seat.

Because when you stop waiting to be invited…you start building your own table.

No noise. No crowd. No external validation.

Just conviction.

That kind of power doesn’t come from applause, it’s forged in solitude.

The kind where you learn how to think clearly, move decisively, and stay rooted even when no one’s cheering.

Most people crumble when they’re overlooked.

But the ones who thrive?

They’ve already lived without the spotlight.

They’ve already learned how to rise without a hand to hold.

So the next time they try to shake your confidence, remember this:

They can take the stage.

You’ve got the foundation.

What’s stronger than applause? Knowing you never needed it.

Who are you when no one’s watching… and would you still choose to be that version if no one ever clapped?

This is the strength I talk about often—the strength that’s born from letting go of needing approval, from choosing your truth even if it costs you people. It’s not easy, but once you get there, you never go back.
I enjoy my company sooo much, I don’t mind being alone, traveling alone. Very ok infact. Trust me, it look a lot to get there
When you master the Art of solitude you are wild beast . ❤️ The gift of solitude  is one of the most underrated gifts in life and leadership.Solitude connects you to God, yourself, and others. It gives life🙏😍❤️
This is me and I absolutely love her ❤️
I felt every word ❤️
💯% There’s a powerful & unshakable peace that rises within when you finally arrive at that place of knowing your worth—whether you’re standing alone or surrounded by strangers. It’s in that stillness you realize: I am enough. I am my own validation. And from there, everything begins to change.
💯❤️🙏AMEN IAM 1 OF THEM
Amen
Self love is the best. I feel peace when im alone. Im happy💯👏😍
This is brillant",motivation

✨10 incredible places to visit in England…👇

I will always love England! It’s one of the most diverse countries I’ve visited, so much of it is vastly underrated, and, well, it’s my home, so I have a soft spot for it!🥹

These are 10 of my favourite places to visit in England, from woodland, to beaches, to mountains, and caves. You’ll want to save this for your UK summer bucket list:

- Lydford Gorge, Devon 💚
- Durdle Door, Dorset 🌊
- Puzzlewood, Gloucestershire 🌳
- The Needles, Isle of Wight ☀️
- Bamford Edge, Peak District ⛰️
- Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland 🏰

United Kingdom","So so beautiful ❤️. Adding these spots to our UK bucketlist!
Beautiful, wish I had time! Maybe my next trip.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Taking notes ✍️
Been to Durdle Door a few years ago and it is amazing. The UK is much more than just London.... I just got back from Snowdonia and it was wonderful!😍
Wow 😮 it's like magical but most go for the city life never been to the UK actually
England is one of my favorite countries and even though we’ve been numerous times there is so much more I want to see!!
Never understand people not visiting our beautiful countryside and coastal resorts. Northumberland and Bamburgh Castle are fabulous
I’ve been to six of them
Durdle door and the needles off Poole area is lovely. Great mtn biking, pints, rock climbing and good nosh in the local pubs corfe castle.
Every trip…4 days London, ten days wandering.
Must you have a car to visit these sites?
What about central Milton Keynes 🔥😂
So glad the Isle of Wight and the needles are in there. That is why I grew up.
To visit all those you need to have a good weather and plan ahead. Impossible to do.",informational

a close-up view of a small stream with fallen white and pink flower petals floating on the surface and resting on mossy rocks. The water flows gently over the rocks, creating a serene and natural scene. The moss-covered rocks add a vibrant green contrast to the delicate petals and the clear water. The lighting suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the soft and peaceful atmosphere of the setting.

Flamingos & Egrets Aerial Grace in Motion
🦩✨🕊️

A rare visual symphony from above flamingos dancing over sapphire waters, egrets gliding across emerald fields and golden wetlands. These graceful birds were filmed using a high zoom drone camera, ensuring their natural behavior remained untouched.

📌 Important Notes for Drone Enthusiasts:

✅ Always maintain a safe and respectful distance from wildlife.
✅ Use zoom-capable drones to film responsibly without intrusion.
✅ Avoid disturbing roosting or breeding birds their peace is priority.
✅ Know your local drone laws and fly only with proper experience and care.

Let’s capture beauty without compromise preserving the wild, the free, and the breathtaking for generations to come.

This season is nature’s embrace,
healing all it touches. Broken hearts find
solace in the rhythmic dance of raindrops,
while anxious minds are soothed by the
symphony of showers.
Shattered souls are revived, much like
the parched earth drinking in the rain.
Forests come alive with vibrant greens,
rivers swell with life, and everything feels
renewed.

Couldn’t we all use that?

I can’t imagine anything more relaxing right now than escaping to a cabin in the woods for a few days together. You can turn your phone off, pick up a book, find a comfy spot (we have so many, inside and out!), listen to the crickets and the cicadas, and just fully leave the world behind.

If you’re thinking about that for your summer plans, I’ve got great news:

☀️Our July-September calendar has officially opened! 🏔️🌲

If you got our newsletter then you know that there’s a lot of good reasons to plan a trip out to Western North Carolina. There’s festivals, concerts, markets, hikes, swimming holes.. all the best summer vibes AND early fall vibes too!

This is a very busy time of year for us so if you’re thinking about booking a stay, now is your chance.

And hey, while some of our weekends have already booked, Labor Day is still open for now 😉

We’re available on Airbnb and VRBO - check our calendar for more info 🫶

🌊 Shiva & Parvati: The Forgotten Temple Beneath the Sea 🕉️
A team of Tamil scuba divers descends into the deep blue — where coral-covered ruins whisper the story of a submerged sanctuary lost to time.

Hidden inside an ancient underwater cave, they discover a colossal temple: Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati seated in eternal meditation, untouched by centuries, bathed in beams of sunlight breaking through the ocean. 🛕✨

Fish swirl around towering tridents. Bioluminescent murals glow faintly along crumbling walls. And conch shells lie scattered across the sacred seabed — echoing legends once thought mythical.

Crafted with love by @jayprints

Here are 3 easy ways to learn to fly FPV drones 👇

Most fun - Beginner FPV kits from companies like beta FPV, let you fly a micro drone with the headset and remote included, for roughly £200 🎮 I find these difficult personally as they move really fast, but there’s something fun about flying a tiny drone 🙌

Least expensive - A simulator and a remote will allow you to learn how to fly in full manual, with unlimited crashes 🙌

If I were to start today - I would get the avata 1 or 2, depending on budget and first get used to flying in sports mode with the goggles… I would also get a simulator, to learn manual mode before my first full Acro flight 🤩

Hope this helps some of you, feel free to reach out if you ever need tips on this 💫

Healthy Habits at 60 I Wish I Knew at 30

If I could go back and give my 30-year-old self some real advice, this would be it:

1️⃣ Sleep is your superpower. You can grind on little sleep in your 30s, but it’ll cost you in your 50s. Prioritize rest now, thank yourself later.

2️⃣ Strength train consistently. Not to get ripped — to stay mobile, independent, and pain-free as you age.

3️⃣ Whole food > fast food. Every meal is either fueling your future or feeding your problems. Trust me, I worked in fast food for 30 years, you are what you eat.

4️⃣ Stress is a silent killer. Learn to manage it early — through breathwork, movement, time in nature, or saying “no” more often.

5️⃣ Don’t skip your annual bloodwork. Health isn’t just how you look — it’s what’s happening inside.

6️⃣ Your habits will outlive your motivation. Build routines that support the life you want — even when you’re not feeling it.

7️⃣ Mobility is medicine. Stretch, roll, move your joints daily. It’s not just for recovery — it’s for function.

8️⃣ Hydration affects everything. Your energy, digestion, skin, joints, and even mood. Drink water like it’s part of your job.

9️⃣ Waking up early is a gift. Quiet 5am mornings are the best time to move your body, clear your head, and set your tone for the day.

🔟 Hike more. Nature is therapy. It clears your mind, strengthens your body, and reminds you that you’re part of something bigger.

I didn’t know any of this in my 30s. I figured it - eventually.
 But now that I’m in my 60s, I feel stronger, sharper, and more than I ever expected.
 It’s never too early to start — and never too late to change.

City life doesn’t feel like living to me anymore. It feels like I’m just surviving — always rushing, always chasing something I don’t even want.

I don’t want a big title, a corner office, or a life that looks perfect on paper but feels empty inside.
I want peace. I want freedom. I want to slow down. I want a life that feels real.

Maybe it’s hard to understand, especially when the world tells us what “success” should look like.
But my version of success is simple — to be happy, to be free, and to wake up every day feeling alive, not drained.

So here’s me, quietly choosing a different path. A slower one. A softer one. One that feels like home.

A beautiful pathway lined with cherry blossom trees in full bloom, featuring delicate white and pink flowers. The petals have fallen onto the stone-paved walkway, creating a picturesque scene next to a calm lake with mountains in the background. The soft colors and serene atmosphere make it a breathtaking spring landscape.🌿🌳🏡

Posting 3x a week feels balanced.
But if you’re serious about growth, it’s slowing you down.

When you post every day, 3 things happen:

1️⃣ You improve faster Content is a skill. The more you post, the faster you refine your hooks, visuals, and ideas. Reps = Mastery. 🧠

2️⃣ You gather more data Daily posting gives you immediate feedback: What’s working, what’s not, which topics convert. You adapt in real time. 📊

3️⃣ You stay top of mind The algorithm favors consistency. And your audience? They forget fast. Daily content keeps you visible, relevant, and building trust. 💬

Don’t aim for balance. Aim for momentum. ⚡

PM Modi Vows to Bear “Heavy Price” to Defend Farmers Amid US Trade War

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at the M. S. Swaminathan Centenary International Conference, declared on August 7, 2025, that he is “ready to pay a heavy price” to safeguard the welfare of India’s farmers, dairy producers, and fishermen. He emphasized that despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S., India will never compromise on the interests of its agricultural sector—even as U.S. tariffs on Indian imports surge to 50% .

This firm stance comes in response to measures by President Donald Trump, who imposed a second tranche of tariffs citing India’s continued oil and defense procurement ties with Russia. Despite prolonged negotiations—including five rounds of trade talks—the deal remains elusive as India resists opening up its agricultural markets under pressure from the U.S.

Powerful words from PM Modi. Standing firm for our farmers, fishermen, and dairy sector even in the face of global pressure is true leadership. If protecting Bharat’s backbone comes at a price, so be it. We won’t trade dignity for diplomacy. Jai Kisan! 🇮🇳🌾

Love mountain views but not into long hikes? ⛰️✨ These 5 spots offer incredible views with minimal effort – no hiking required 🥾❌

🚗 All of them are accessible by car or gondola and offer unreal views with minimal effort.

🌟 1. Seceda Take the cable car from Ortisei and you’ll be standing on one of the most iconic ridgelines in the Dolomites — with unreal panoramic views and dramatic peaks.

🌟 2. Lago di Carezza A small but stunning turquoise lake. Just a few steps from the parking lot, this one is picture-perfect at sunrise!

🌟 3. Passo Gardena One of the most scenic mountain passes, right between Val Gardena and Corvara. Stop for a coffee and take in the views — especially at sunset.

🌟 4. Lago di Braies Famous for a reason. This emerald lake is easy to reach by car and perfect for a peaceful stroll or classic rowboat photo.

🌟 5. Passo delle Erbe A quiet gem in the Dolomites, surrounded by rolling meadows and the impressive Sass de Putia. Great spot for a picnic with a view.

In the East, there’s a land known for its wisdom, resilience, and numbers — over a billion strong. For centuries, it watched silently as others took the spotlight.

But silence doesn’t mean weakness.
It builds. It plans. It rises.

Now, the sleeping force is wide awake — shaping alliances, shifting economies, and rewriting the rules.

To go against it?
History shows… that’s never been a wise move.""_

Rising up over a soft bed of moss and the rushing waters of a forest river, the view opens up to a magnificent waterfall cascading through the lush green landscape. There’s something deeply peaceful about this moment—the sound of the water, the vibrant forest all around, and the sense of calm that only time in nature can bring. If you’re someone who finds peace in the outdoors or loves exploring wild, untouched places, this is for you. A quiet reminder to slow down and reconnect with the natural world ☺️

Election commission of India corruption 📈

Rahul Gandhi - RESET Button 🔘✅
Election commission of india ❌ Bjp planning ✅
Pointing out flaws is fine .yes, fake addresses in voter lists are a serious concern. But when it comes from someone who once called India a ‘dead economy’ and insulted the country abroad, it’s hard to take it seriously. Leadership isn’t about just pointing fingers ,it’s about responsibility, vision, and respect for the nation. Sadly, Rahul Gandhi has failed on all three
Fake election 😮😮 But nothing happens. India is a joke for a democratic country.
We need a leader like him in India for the better future ❤️
BJP propaganda is labeling Rahul Gandhi as a ""pappu"" to give a general impression of him as a buffoon to the public. The actual fear is he can outsmart all of them

Welcome to…

📍Salaam cave, Zanzibar

Saalam cave is located in the South of Zanzibar and is a stunning, clear watered sanctuary for turtles. Animals are brought there that have been injured/ caught in plastic/fishing nets etc. for rehabilitation/conservation. Once healed they are released back to their home!

When visiting, you get to feed, swim and hang with the turtles in this amazing setting!

💰 Entrance fee: ~$10 per person for half an hour (price increases for longer visits)

Visiting this spot after seeing it online was such a dream come true! Would you visit if travelling to Zanzibar?🐢

A beautifully expressed reminder that true connection feels like safety and harmony, where presence brings peace instead of chaos.
Our nervous system is our best monitor, so helpful to distinguish between what is healthy for us vs. just chemistry. 🌿✨
This is beautiful

Some people walk in and feel like a deep breath you didn’t know you needed.

Not loud.
Not intense.
Just... ease.

That’s vibrational alignment. It’s not about sparks or chaos; it’s about meeting someone and your nervous system says: “Ah, yes. Safe here.”

I used to chase intensity, thinking that was connection.
Now? If it doesn’t feel like peace, I’m not subscribing.
This is for the ones who’ve done the work, who’ve healed enough to crave harmony over hype.

To recognize when a connection isn’t forcing, it’s flowing.

Try this little vibe check:

✨ Notice who calms your nervous system.
✨ Observe how your body reacts when they walk in.
✨ Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around them.
✨ Reflect: is it chemistry or chaos?

Choose connections that don’t collide, but harmonize.
Because when two souls vibrate at the same frequency, it’s not a battle, it’s music.

If your soul’s been craving those high-frequency connections, start within.
Clean the static in your own mind first.
That’s the whole essence behind The Worthy Mind, so you stop settling for noise and start attracting peace.

Tap the link in bio, shift your mindset, and raise your frequency.

Follow this Revolutionary community, we’re just getting started. 🖤✨🤍

Cobra pose, part of yoga exercises. It does worked. I do it 10 to 20x a day. First time I tried it I could only manage 2x. My full body was shaking. It was hard bc I’m not used to it. I was very determined! Lost a lot of weight all over my body. It was recommended by my physical therapist bc my knee hurts. Can’t dance if your knee hurts. I was 70 years old when I started this exercise, now at 76 years old,  I’m more fit than ever.

Se você colocar uma casa 🏠 flutuante nessa altura, com tecnologia em baixo da casa , ou alguns propulsores....Mas a casa de madeira com varanda e um menino tomando um café e fumando um cigarro ou lendo um livro, vai ficar incrível. A mensagem é que tem pessoas que são buscadores de silêncio e meditação. E isso está em alta, E também seria só nessa altura com casas flutuantes que você teria silêncio e segurança, vai transmitir uma paz de espírito maior porque a casa fala sobre conforto, então o desconforto do vazio e da altura vão desaparecer e essa arte fica completa! Mas está perfeita assim também ♥️

Just did this swell and it works!!! Going to add to my Pre skate stretch routine
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS THAT TEACH ME NEW TRICK TO BE HEALTHY
I love this account but also, bros should just do yoga
Should I do this with hardware and lateral mass screws holding my C1 to my brain stem together? It's been 5 years since surgery. I'm on progressively more neck pain, which aging is not helping. I'm 62. Thoughts?
Do you have YouTube channel?
Hi - I’ve been following your account and your exercises for a while..I have spinal arthritis and psoriasis arthritis, and I’m struggling with facet syndrome..which really hurts when I have an ‘attack’ - do you have any exercises that could help relieve the pain? It is always in my upper body, by my chest or feels like between my shoulder blades (where my bh is placed on the back) thanks 🙏🏼
Woke up with that. Gonna try this 👍🏻
You exercises are really very helpful to me.💐💐💐my thousand thanks from the bottom of my heart💕💕💕
Thank you 😊 going to try this out 🙌
Thank you! I get those knots behind the shoulder blades quite a bit. It happened about 3 days ago. Can't wait to try this.

സ്വപ്നം പീലി നീർത്തി നിന്നതോ

ഇവിടെയൊന്നു ചേർന്നലിഞ്ഞതോ’
ദേവരാജൻ മാഷിന്റെ ഈ മനോഹര സംഗീതത്തിലേക്ക് യേശുദാസിന്റെ സ്വരവും കൂടി കലരുമ്പോൾ കിട്ടുന്നൊരു ഫീൽ ഉണ്ട്. ആ സുഖം ആസ്വദിക്കാത്ത മലയാളികൾ വിരളമാകും. എത്ര കേട്ടാലും മതിവരാത്ത, കേൾക്കുന്തോറും ഇമ്പമേറുന്ന ഈ പാട്ടിനോട് ഉപമിക്കാം മൂന്നാറിലെ ഗ്യാപ് റോഡിലെ കാഴ്ചകളെ.

മൂന്നാർ ‍ടൗണിൽനിന്ന് 13 കിലോമീറ്റർ തേയിലത്തോട്ടങ്ങളുടെയും താഴ്‌വരകളുടെയും പ്രകൃതിരമണീയമായ കാഴ്ചകൾ കണ്ട് മുന്നോട്ടു പോകുമ്പോൾ വളഞ്ഞുപുളഞ്ഞ് കണ്ണാടി പോലെയുള്ള മനോഹരമായ റോഡിലേക്ക് എത്തും. ഇവിടെ തുടങ്ങുകയാണ് ഗ്യാപ് റോഡ് എന്നു പേരായ, എന്നാൽ കാഴ്ചകൾക്ക് ഒരു ഗ്യാപ്പും കൊടുക്കാത്ത അതിസുന്ദരയിടം. മുകളിൽ പറഞ്ഞ ഗാനത്തിന്റെ ഈരടികളിൽ പറയുന്നതു പോലെ ‘മലയെടുത്തു മടിയിൽ വച്ച മേഘങ്ങൾ’ ആണ് ഇവിടുത്തെ മുഖ്യ കാഴ്ച. മേഘശകലങ്ങളുടെ പശ്ചാത്തലത്തിൽ മുട്ടുകാട് പാടശേഖരത്തിന്റെ വിദൂര ദൃശ്യം ഗ്യാപ് റോഡിൽനിന്നു കാണാം. ഇവിടെയെത്തുമ്പോൾ മേഘശകലങ്ങളുടെ മുകളിലൂടെയാണു യാത്ര ചെയ്യുന്നത് എന്നു തോന്നിയാലും തെറ്റില്ല.

Testosterone Support Tonic: Fenugreek & Ginger Infusion Fenugreek seeds are rich in furostanolic saponins, compounds that may help support overall hormonal balance, energy levels, and vitality. They are also thought to assist with insulin sensitivity and promote a healthy metabolism. Regular consumption, along with a balanced lifestyle, may contribute to muscle strength, help manage stress-related hormones, and support general well-being.

How to Prepare:
✅ Soak 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and 1-inch ginger in 1 cup of water overnight.
✅ Strain and enjoy in the morning on an empty stomach.

How to Use:
🔹 Many people incorporate this for 6-8 weeks, followed by a short break.
🔹 Consistency is key—listen to your body and adjust as needed.
🔹 Add a squeeze of lemon 🍋 for extra digestive support!

Why You Might Love This:
1. May Support Hormonal Balance – Fenugreek is traditionally used to promote overall wellness.
2. Aids Digestion & Metabolism – Ginger may help with nutrient absorption and gut health.
3. Rich in Antioxidants – Supports the body’s natural detox process.

What about the seeds? Not have them??
We have to eat Fenugreek seeds or only drink Fenugreek water or can we drink in summer also
Progesterone increase sollunga
Make one for gut health and fatloss 👏
What’s the science here?
Some methods in this video might work short-term, but sustainable testosterone boosts come from consistent lifestyle changes like strength training, good sleep, and a balanced diet. Always check scientific sources before trying extreme methods
Hot water or normal water?
Anyone tried?
Get zinc too. It boost testosterone. But max 25. I forgot the unit to measure it. If I'd say grams won't make sense. But just eat half the pill. Of the supplement. Normally the ones I got are 75. When I take it whole it makes my stomach bad lol. So half of it, magnesium ( glicynate ) do work outs and get rid of sugars. You'll build up testosterone.

✅7 Yoga Asanas to balance your 7 chakras.

📌Yoga asanas help balance chakras by addressing the physical and energetic aspects associated with each energy center. Here’s a general overview:

1. Root Chakra: Asanas that emphasize grounding and stability support this chakra, enhancing feelings of security and balance.

2. Sacral Chakra: Poses that open and stretch the hips can help release emotional blockages and stimulate creativity and emotional health.

3. Solar Plexus Chakra: Core-strengthening asanas can build confidence and personal power by energizing and activating this center.

4. Heart Chakra: Chest-opening poses promote love, compassion, and emotional healing by encouraging an open heart.

5. Throat Chakra: Asanas that involve stretching and opening the throat area support clear communication and self-expression.

6. Third Eye Chakra: Forward bends and poses that involve introspection can enhance intuition and mental clarity.

7. Crown Chakra: Inverted poses and meditation can help cultivate a sense of spiritual connection and higher consciousness.

Don’t try to master all 5 habits at once.
Focus on just one each month. Stack them slowly — that’s how real transformation happens. 💯

Save this reel, and if you’re ready to start strong —
comment “LEVEL UP” and I’ll DM you the monthly habit tracker 👇

🎯 Discipline isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being better than yesterday.

The Faroe Islands are known for some of the most unique coastlines in the North Atlantic. Steep sea cliffs, hidden inlets, and sea stacks create a landscape that feels untouched.

Along the coast, you’ll find dramatic drops into the ocean, bird colonies, and narrow passages shaped by wind and waves over thousands of years. It’s one of the most distinctive features of the islands, and a highlight for hiking, photography, and explorinG ✨

Did you know?
A fatty liver often has no symptoms—but it can silently affect your energy, hormones, and digestion.

✅ Add:

Lemon ginger water in the morning

1/4 tsp turmeric in meals

A 10-min walk after eating

Your liver works hard for you—give it a little love back.

📍Tuvvur Railway Station,Malappuram,Kerala
കേരളത്തിലെ മലപുരം ജില്ലയിലെ തുവ്വൂർ പട്ടണത്തിൽ സേവനം ചെയ്യുന്ന ഒരു ചെറിയ റെയിൽ‌വേ സ്റ്റേഷനാണ് തുവ്വൂർ റെയിൽ‌വേ സ്റ്റേഷൻ.

ഷൊർണൂർ-നിലമ്പൂർ സെക്ഷനിലാണ് ഇത് സ്ഥിതി ചെയ്യുന്നത്. സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ നിർത്തുന്ന ട്രെയിനുകൾ നിലമ്പൂർ - ഷൊർണൂർ - അങ്ങാടിപ്പുറം തുടങ്ങിയ പ്രമുഖ നഗരങ്ങളുമായി പട്ടണത്തെ ബന്ധിപ്പിക്കുന്നു. മേലാറ്റൂർ ടൗണിൽ നിന്നും 850 മീറ്റർ ദൂരമേയുള്ളൂ റയിൽവേ സ്റ്റേഷനിലേക്ക്.

ട്രാക്കിനോട് ചേർന്ന് ഇരുവശത്തും മരങ്ങളും, സസ്യജാലങ്ങളും സ്ഥിതിചെയ്യുന്നു. സ്റ്റേഷനു ചുറ്റും മരങ്ങൾ ഉള്ളതിനാൽ ചെറിയ തണലും, തണുപ്പും അനുഭവപ്പെടുന്നു.

റയിൽവേ സ്റ്റേഷന് പുറത്ത് വാഗമരങ്ങൾ /ഗുൽമോഹർ മരങ്ങലാനുള്ളത് ഏപ്രിൽ, മെയ് മാസങ്ങളിൽ മരത്തിൽ നിന്നും ഗുൽമോഹർ പൂക്കൾ താഴേക്ക് വീണ് ഒരു മനോഹരമായ ചുവന്ന പരവതാനി വിരിച്ച ഒരു ഫീൽ കിട്ടും.

Have you walked a path worthy of your eyes? A trail that doesn’t merely stretch before you but unfolds like a whispered hymn to the earth, a quiet symphony of wind, wood, and distant peaks? In Moieciu de Sus, where the land rises and falls in gentle waves of emerald, where an old wooden fence stands like the stave of an unwritten melody, the world feels as if it is exhaling, unrushed, eternal. Here, the air carries the scent of damp earth and wildflowers, the sky is a vast canvas of drifting light, and the mountains hold their breath, watching, waiting.

The path meanders like a thought left to wander—beneath your feet, the earth is soft, kissed by time, marked by the hooves of passing flocks and the careful steps of those who still listen to the land. The fence, weathered and worn, its beams darkened by years of rain and sun, does not merely divide but guides, a silent companion leading you through a world untouched by haste. Beyond it, hills roll like the crests of a slumbering sea, each rise and dip an invitation to step further into this untouched reverie. Shadows stretch long in the golden hours, painting the pastures in hues of honey and dusk, while the wind hums its ageless tune through the pines.

There are places that quiet the mind and stir the soul, places where beauty does not beg for attention but exists, unshaken, for those who choose to see. This is such a place—a threshold between the seen and the felt, the present and the timeless. When was the last time you stood still and let the world move around you?

Ever raised your arms and felt numbness, tingling, or that “dead arm” sensation?

You’re not imagining it it’s real, and it has everything to do with blood flow in arms and neural compression.

When you raise arms, circulation can get restricted especially if there’s tension in your shoulders, neck, or chest.
Our reel shows exactly how it looks almost like an arm raise X-ray effect as the blood literally drains due to position.

This can lead to:
🔸 Numbness in hands
🔸 Arm heaviness
🔸 Poor circulation in hands
🔸 Even hand tingling and nerve irritation

It may be a sign of thoracic outlet compression where tight muscles or posture reduce flow and pressure nerves or vessels.

The good news? You don’t need surgery.
You need the right nerve glide exercise, paired with shoulder mobility drills and targeted release.

This reel includes an overhead stretch relief move that instantly helps decompress and restore motion.
Try it and feel the circulation boost.
Because small shifts in movement = big shifts in function.

3 asanas to release Gas & Bloating problems ✅

These poses are excellent to release the flatulence to have a good massage to the abdominal region. It’s not important to touch the toe in hast pad angushthasana but to lift the legs up straight from the ground as it gives strong intra abdominal compression that helps your body❗️

Helps release all the unwanted gases which are there in our stomach🥴

Along with these asanas, be mindful about your eating patterns, type of food you eat and how well it suits your body. Maintain an active lifestyle, after eating food - don’t just sit at one place, take a walk, after some time lie down on your left side for better digestion to avoid gases to be formed ✅

Neck pain? Cervical pain?

Liver Support Morning Drink
Your liver does over 500 functions in the body — from filtering toxins to digesting fats and regulating metabolism. But sometimes, it becomes sluggish and starts storing excess fat, leading to what’s known as fatty liver.
Try this ancient-inspired remedy to gently support your liver and digestion

Drink daily on an empty stomach for 6 months.

Ingredients:
🌱 1 inch fresh ginger
🌱 1 inch fresh turmeric
🌱 1 cup hot water
🌱 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
🌱 Juice of 1/2 lemon

How to Make It:
1️⃣ Steep ginger + turmeric in hot water for 10 minutes
2️⃣ Strain, then add olive oil and lemon juice
3️⃣ Sip slowly on an empty stomach
4️⃣ Follow with warm water if desired for better digestion

⚠️ This is a supportive wellness drink, not a cure. Please consult your doctor if you have health concerns or are on medications.

God created vs human creation
The best lifestyle.1. No Ultra Processed foods & Sugary foods.2. No Seeds Oils or bad Fats3. Engage in 16:8 hours, intermittent fasting.4. Eat your vegetables 1st, proteins & healthy fats & Oils b4 carbs. (Natural, Whole, Organics)5. No Snacking.6. Exercise immediately after eating (15 minutes walk).7. Sleep well.8. Add Sunlight.9. Walk barefeet on Nature (connect with nature)10. Pray always.IN ALL, CONSISTENCY IS THE KEY
Absolutely.... & Ppl feel our traditional food is not healthy...
Most people today are getting overweight 🧈 and falling sick 🤒 not because of age or genes, but because of what we eat 🍟 and how we live 🛋️.We’ve replaced natural, simple food with:🍶 Refined oils ❌ instead of ghee or cold-pressed oils ✅🍫 Packaged snacks ❌ instead of fresh fruits 🍎✅🥤 Sugary drinks ❌ instead of lemon water or plain water 💧✅🍱 Instant food ❌ instead of home-cooked meals 🥘✅Some simple changes that work wonders:🌞 Start your day with warm water & light meals🛢️ Use mustard, coconut, or ghee – not refined oils🍌 Eat 2 seasonal fruits daily🍯 Ditch white sugar – use jaggery or dates🚶‍♂️ Move daily – a short walk or 20 min of yoga😴 Sleep on time – your body repairs itself at night✨ Good health isn’t about fancy diets – it’s about going back to basics. 🌿
Good creation is good but human creation is dangerous
Just avoid palm oil and detox with amla juice
The path which leads to destruction is always easier than the one which leads to nourishment and prosperity
If those r not healthy, government can take actions right

Here are some reliable paraphrasing tools for Essays and Research Papers 👇

1. Paperpal
Paperpal Rewrite offers powerful features for academic writing. It helps you paraphrase with tone adjustments, reduce word count precisely, and supports 30+ languages—giving you output in the same language you input. It suggests sentence-level edits so you stay in control, and always keeps your scientific meaning intact.

2. QuillBot
QuillBot is one of the most popular tools for paraphrasing. Its standout features include custom modes, a synonym slider, and the ability to freeze words you don’t want changed. It supports paraphrasing in 20 languages and offers a range of rewriting options.

3. Wordtune
Loved by content creators, Wordtune understands context well and offers sentence-level rewrites, tone shifts, and smoother phrasing—while staying true to your original message.

4. Paraphrasing.io
This NLP-based tool helps rewrite text with tone options like Fluent and Standard. The Creative tone is available in the paid version.

5. WordAI
WordAI rewrites content to sound more human and bypass AI detectors. It restructures sentences, enriches content, and improves clarity with minimal effort.

📌 Why choose Paperpal?
Unlike others, Paperpal suggests accurate academic phrasing without rewriting your whole text blindly. You stay in charge—reviewing, editing, and approving each sentence to retain precision and meaning.

Liver Support Morning Drink
Your liver does over 500 functions in the body — from filtering toxins to digesting fats and regulating metabolism. But sometimes, it becomes sluggish and starts storing excess fat, leading to what’s known as fatty liver.
Try this ancient-inspired remedy to gently support your liver and digestion

Drink daily on an empty stomach for 6 months.

Ingredients:
🌱 1 inch fresh ginger
🌱 1 inch fresh turmeric
🌱 1 cup hot water
🌱 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
🌱 Juice of 1/2 lemon

How to Make It:
1️⃣ Steep ginger + turmeric in hot water for 10 minutes
2️⃣ Strain, then add olive oil and lemon juice
3️⃣ Sip slowly on an empty stomach
4️⃣ Follow with warm water if desired for better digestion

⚠️ This is a supportive wellness drink, not a cure. Please consult your doctor if you have health concerns or are on medications.

How to practice:
Sit comfortably and take back support for comfort.

Take the mudra but make sure to not make the mudra too tight. Relax your hands and shoulders too.

Now close your eyes and make your breath nice and easy. Keep Your awareness on the breath.

As you go into a meditative state, take your awareness on your thoughts. Let them melt away.

Be there for 15mins.

Regular practice will bring more positivity in your life.

Do you also struggle with negative thinking?

🚀Remote jobs are on the rise in many countries because most NA companies are outsourcing jobs internationally. Whether you're in tech, marketing, finance, healthcare, or customer support, these platforms provide remote work opportunities catering to diverse experience levels, from entry-level to senior executives positions.

➡️ Follow+ Comment “ Remote Jobs” and I will DM you the links to all the remote websites that have jobs available in every field. Be sure to follow and comment cause instagram will only let me share the links if you’re following me !!

✅ Remote Jobs are increasing internationally( yes i know its down in North America) because unfortunately for us, most companies are outsourcing professionals internationally( from Latin America, Asia, Africa, India, some parts of Europe) which saves them 💰 compared to hiring someone in US/ Canada especially right now !! But, if you are residing in any of those countries, take a look at the Remote Job sites that will help you land a remote or Work from home job opportunity 👩🏻‍💻

➡️ Key tips to keep in mind when applying for remote Jobs:

🚀 Apply for U.S. time zone jobs, as many companies prefer hiring from Latin America, Africa, or Asia to save money. Look for “Global” or “Anywhere” roles.
🚀 Use keywords like “100% remote”, “work from anywhere”, or “async work” to find true remote-first companies.
🚀 Tailor your resume with necessary keywords that match the job posting & use ATS to align your resume to the posting.
🚀 Cold email hiring managers on Linkedin with a concise message highlighting why you’re a great fit.

LinkedIn is the #1 tool to get jobs right now - but a lot of people still use it in the wrong way.

Here is how you can build a better profile to attract more job offers and get recruiters reaching out to you ‼️ Just use these prompts on CHATGPT:

1️⃣ Skills
“I’m currently applying for [POSITION]. I want you to help me find what are the top skills I need to be including in my LinkedIn profile to better otimize it for search. I’ll paste below 5 job descriptions for ideal jobs I want to apply for. Give me the top 15 skills I need to focus on (Paste 5 different job descriptions).

2️⃣ LinkedIn Headline:
“I’m currently applying for [POSITION]. I’ll paste below the key skills I need in order to land that position alongside my CV. Based on both my CV, my qualifications and the relevant skills/keywords, write a compelling LinkedIn headline for me. (Paste your CV and the most relevant skills for the position).”

3️⃣ About Section:
“Based on my CV and the roles in applying for, help me write my LinkedIn summary. Keep it 3 paragraphs maximum and highlight my key achievements, the main skills I have that will help me get this position. Also add some personality and interested to it (paste CV).”

4️⃣ Work Experience:
“Take the bullet points from my CV on each of my experiences and make them into a short paragraph of 3 sentences maximum. Highlight my key tasks, achievements and add metrics. [Paste bullet points]”

5️⃣ Ask for Referrals
“I need to ask previous colleagues and managers to give me recommendations for my LinkedIn profile. Help me craft a message asking for a referral.”

‼️ For the profile picture you can use AI tools like tryiton AI that will help you make professional images!

‼️ For your banner use tools like Canva to make something more personal and creative - DON’T LEAVE IT BLANK!

If you want access to these prompts and a LinkedIn cheat sheet, just leave a comment below ⬇️

And the answer is...

Digital Affiliate Marketing 😎

If you're not doing affiliate marketing... You're leaving money and options on the table. 😬

I started 2 months ago with no followers, no tech skills, and no clue what I was doing.

Since then, I've been steadily growing, gaining leads, and made my 1st sale! 🤑

All you need to make this work is:
📱A phone or laptop
🛜 Wi-Fi
⌚️ 2-3hrs a day

What you Don't need to do is:
🚫 Have a degree or tech skills
🚫 Buy or Handle Inventory
🚫 Create a product
🚫 Spend all day in an office
🚫 Answer to a boss
🚫 Sell to friends or family

And the best part? 😃
I found a 90% automated Done-For-You system! So all the technical stuff is taken care of for me, and all I have to do is focus on creating simple 5-7 sec reels.

I'm leveraging AI to my advantage the same way you saw in my video with the stories. The world is changing, and AI is changing the game.

Interested in learning more? 🤗
Like this post & comment ""STORY""
I'll send a FREE video guide that will tell you the story of affiliate marketing and show you how you can get started, too! 📹

I'm also here to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to send me a DM 📩 as well, but make sure you're following me first so I can receive it!

If you've been feeling stuck, this might be the sign you've been waiting for. So don't wait!

Websites That Can Help You Build Income From Home 👇🏻

You don’t need a huge following or be an influencer to start making money on social media in 2025. All you need is your phone, a laptop, some Wi-Fi, and a couple hours to work on your goals.

This is exactly how everyday people are ditching the 9-5 grind with Digital Affiliate Marketing!

Here’s why this is a game-changer:

+ No tech skills needed
+ No followers required
+ Work from home
+ No dealing with customers, shipping, inventory, or building a team

It’s the same model that took me from broke to earning 5 figure months in just 3 months!

🎯People are becoming financial independent without creating product, inventory, or even without showing their face?!

I wish I knew and started this sooner....

As a Student , I wanted to contribute financially but didn’t want to sacrifice my studies , invest huge money. Then I found affiliate marketing.

Now? I have the flexibility to work from anywhere, having freedom of time and luxury to spend time with my family and become independent in just my 20s. ❤️

Affiliate marketing .

✅No product creation
✅No customer service
✅No big following needed

Just sharing products you love & getting paid for it
— just like influencers do, but WITHOUT the hassle.
📌87% of companies already have affiliate programs.
You just need to tap into them!

🚨Here are 6 ways you can literally get paid to read plus the online income stream I personally chose that changed everything👇 Mom of 5 Earning Online? YES, and Here’s How I Got Paid Just to READ 📚 (Plus the Side Hustle That Changed EVERYTHING)

If you love reading and you’re constantly on the go (hello, #momlife), here are 6 REAL ways you can literally get paid to read — even during nap time or school drop-offs:

🔹 Audiobook Narrator – $10 to $500/hr
Use your voice on platforms like ACX, Voices.com, or Findaway Voices. Great if you enjoy reading aloud or storytelling!

🔹 Proofreader – $20 to $50/hr
Catch grammar mistakes on Upwork, Fiverr, or ProofreadingServices.com — perfect for detail-loving mamas.

🔹 Book Reviewer – $5 to $100/review
Write honest reviews for Online Book Club, Kirkus, or Reedsy Discovery.

🔹 Fact-Checker – $20 to $50/hr
Help writers & publishers verify content accuracy. Ideal for curious minds!

🔹 Scribe for the Visually Impaired – $10 to $25/hr
Support others through Learning Ally or Be My Eyes. Get paid and make a difference.

🔹 Script/Content Reader – $50 to $250/project
Review scripts via WeScreenplay or Script Reader Pro. Great if you’re a movie or story buff!

🌟 My Favorite: Freelance Digital Marketing (Affiliate Style)

This one changed everything for me. I started with:
• NO experience
• NO tech skills
• Just my phone, Wi-Fi, and stolen moments between diaper changes & dinner

I tapped into a 90% done-for-you system with built-in mentorship and training.
Now I work from home (or the car pickup line) while raising my 5 little ones ❤️

💬 Want to learn how I did it?

COMMENT “GUIDE” below and I’ll DM you the free beginner-friendly video that explains how I got started — and how you can too.

🔑 Note: This isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a real business that takes time, effort, and consistency but if a busy mom of 5 can do it, you can too.

You don’t need more books.
You need a system that makes your brain dangerous.
This prompt builds that in 30 days.

Prompt:

""You have 30 days to crack a competitive exam.
No prep done. Zero notes. Total panic.
You’re hiring ChatGPT as your ruthless AI study strategist.

Build me a system that turns anyone into a rank-holder, using:

1. Deep syllabus decoding – Find scoring clusters & trap topics

2. AI-generated weekly study plans – 6 hrs/day max, no burnout

3. Micro-notes & atomic summaries – Auto-generated by ChatGPT

4. PYQ mining prompts – To uncover hidden patterns in past papers

5. Mock test loop – Auto-analyze mistakes, plug weak zones

6. Revision hacks – That compress 100 pages into 10 sticky lines

7. Pre-exam ritual builder – To crush anxiety & boost recall

Bonus: Add a stealth prompt to simulate exam pressure & outsmart the test itself.""

🔥 Want the full vault with 50+ prompts?

Here’s how to get it FREE ⬇️

✅ Step 1: Follow @aivellum.ai

Books I’d read if I was starting out now.

Hands on machine learning by Aurelien Geron: Hands down the most important book you’ll ever read. AI beginners think they should skip traditional machine learning but while they’re mastering LLMs and looking for one perfect offer, most people make money with classic ML that works.

Machine learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn: Sebastian Raschka is someone I looked up to when learning machine learning and deep learning. This is the best book to master both.

LLM Engineer’s Handbook: Got this book late last year and I still read and check it whenever I’m stuck. Great breakdown on transformers architecture, LangChain and even some bit about AI agents.

AI Engineering: I thought I knew it all until I grabbed this one. Other creators recommended it, and it goes deep into AI paradigm and modern AI systems work.

Designing machine learning systems: Like I said, machine learning engineering is the software engineering 2.0. This book goes into the entire ML product lifecycle, and I love it!

Follow me @codingmermaid.ai if you like to learn about data science, machine learning and AI, and how to monetize it without being in the corporate. Also, let me know if I should post part 2!

4. Matches Job Keywords – Certifications often match ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters.
5. Shows Proactiveness – Proves you’re serious about learning and career growth.

Google DeepMind just dropped one of the most powerful free AI courses online and it’s pure gold for anyone trying to understand how machines actually learn. 🔥

In this first lecture, they break down the 'Cliff Walking' problem — a classic Reinforcement Learning challenge where an agent must move from Start to Goal without falling off a cliff.

Using algorithms like Q-Learning and Sarsa, the AI learns through trial and error, balancing risk and reward just like humans do.

This isn't just theory — these are the foundations behind self-driving cars, game-playing AIs, and real-world autonomous systems.

If you’ve ever been curious how AI makes decisions, this course is your entry point. 💡🎓

If you’re not doing affiliate marketing in 2025, you’re leaving mulah on the table.

I made $20 on my very first day — no followers, no website, no tech skills.

Here’s how it works:
✅ Promote products that already sell
✅ Earn a commission on every sale
✅ No product creation. No customer service. No stress.

The best part? It’s 95% done for you.

It’s beginner-friendly, 95% automated, and doesn’t require any experience or upfront capital.

📌 Comment “READY” below and I’ll send you the exact training that I used to get started.
 Be sure to follow me so IG doesn’t hide your message @the1beverlysamuel …

… and check your “Requests” tab if you don’t see it right away.

💬 Or DM me “START” if you prefer.

This could be your first step toward real freedom.

Don’t sleep on this.

Your boss doesn’t want you to know this secret…

And at the beginning of last year, I knew NOTHING about it.

But I saw people making real money online and thought,
“What’s going on here? 🤔”

So I got access to a done-for-you tech system with proven offers and started creating 7–15 second Reels…

My first 2 weeks, I earned my first $500 online🙌

And the truth is…
I started from ZERO.

The real secret?
I actually started.

✅ No tech background needed
✅ No following required
✅ Work from your phone, anywhere
✅ No customers, shipping, or inventory

But here’s the thing—choosing the right offer is just the beginning.
The real challenge most people face?
Getting traffic.

That’s where your phone becomes your most powerful asset.

Creating short Reels is how I’ve reached thousands of people, made sales, and started building true time freedom.

🔥 Comment “READY” below and I’ll send you a free beginner-friendly video to help you get started today!

Make sure you’re following me @abundancewithferoz so you can receive my DM!

Please Note: Results are not guaranteed and will vary from person to person. My results came from hard work and sacrifices. Real and long lasting success is all about effort, consistency, and the investment you make in learning and applying the skills. Building a sustainable income takes time and dedication, but it’s absolutely worth it!

Neural networks are not everything! 📥

There are far more efficient algorithms you can use.  - And they actually solve business problems.

Last time I used neural networks with my clients and at my work is over 1 year ago. - if we don't count transformers.

✨In most business scenarios, simpler models like linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, XGBoost) are often sufficient and preferable.

Here's why:

- Simpler models are easier for stakeholders to understand and trust compared to neural networks, which often feel like a “black box.”
- They train faster, use fewer resources, and are easier to deploy—great for tight deadlines.
- Small datasets? No problem. Simpler models are more suitable for smaller datasets.
- They’re less prone to overfitting on low-quality or limited data.
- Adapting to new data is easier, with less tweaking and fine-tuning needed.

Traditional machine learning is still cool and much cheaper to implement for businesses than using LLMs. It's exactly what small businesses need.

I taught machine learning & AI to over 2,000 students. Follow me @codingmermaid.ai and become irreplaceable in tech market.

Cheers,
Danica 🫶🏻

AI Agents are 90% Software Engineering
Only 10% is actually “AI”.

Let me break it down:
🧠 The AI Agent Tech Stack (Simplified):
🔌 Compute Power
Big agents need big energy.
GPUs + CPUs handle the brainwork.

📦 Infrastructure
Containers + cloud tools = agents running 24/7 without crashing.

🗂️ Databases
Agents need fast memory.
That’s how they recall info in real-time.

⚙️ Data Processing
ETL systems clean and prep raw data for the agent to use.

🧠 Language Models
LLMs power the reasoning, thinking, and conversation.

🚦Model Routing
Routes each task to the best model, saving time and cost.

🤖 Agent Protocols
Agents need rules to talk to each other.
Protocols = their language.

🕹️ Orchestration
This is what makes the agent act.
It runs flows and connects to other agents/tools.

🔐 Auth & Permissions
Only trusted agents can do trusted tasks.
Security matters.

📊 Observability
Logs, feedback, analytics, to see what’s working and what’s not.

🧰 Tools
Agents can use APIs, search the web, or pull live data.

🧠 Memory
They remember past convos.
This makes them smarter over time.

🖥️ Front-End
Chat apps, dashboards, or web UIs, where you actually talk to the agent.

If you’re serious about AI agents…
Understand the ecosystem.
Because that’s where the real leverage is.

Follow to get ahead in Ai Agents and Automations.✌️

You don’t need to be a machine learning expert…
…but knowing these 6 algorithms? That’s how you stop being ‘just another analyst’ and start turning heads in the data world. 👀💡

From simple Linear Regression to powerful Decision Trees 🌳 — these algorithms help you do way more than just describe data.

They help you predict, classify, and uncover patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed.

And the best part?
You don’t need a PhD to start using them — just curiosity and the right breakdown (which is exactly what this post gives you). 😉

Read Here ⬇️

Step 1: Redefine “rich” for you (Week 1)
• Decide if “rich” means:
• More money in the bank
• Higher income
• More time freedom
• Better lifestyle
• You can’t hit a target you can’t see.
• Write your target income figure for 6 months from now. Example: “I will earn $10,000/month by Month 6.”

⸻

Step 2: Audit your skills & opportunities (Week 1–2)
• List skills you already have (e.g., writing, selling, coding, design, teaching, marketing).
• List networks or connections you can leverage.
• Research high-demand, high-paying skills you can quickly learn (sales, copywriting, digital marketing, AI automation, etc.).

⸻

Step 3: Choose one high-income path (Week 2)

Pick something that:
1. Requires low capital (service-based work is best at first).
2. Has fast cash flow potential.
3. You can scale or charge high rates within months.

Example Fast-Track Skills:
• High-ticket sales (commission-based)
• Freelance copywriting
• Paid ads management
• Web design for small businesses
• AI tool setup for companies

⸻

Step 4: Execute aggressively (Month 1–3)
• Offer your service for free or cheap to 3–5 clients to get results/testimonials.
• Use cold email, social media outreach, and networking events daily.
• Put in 10–12 hour workdays if necessary — this is your sprint phase.

⸻

Step 5: Raise prices & scale (Month 3–4)
• Take your best result and turn it into a case study.
• Double or triple your rate.
• Outsource low-value work so you can focus on client acquisition and delivery.

⸻

Step 6: Build leverage (Month 4–6)
• Automate and systemize your business so income doesn’t depend 100% on your time.
• Add secondary income streams (affiliate marketing, online course, productized services).
• Keep reinvesting profits into skills, marketing, and tools that grow your income faster.

⸻

💡 Mindset Shift: In this 6-month sprint, you’ll have to drop almost everything that isn’t moving you toward your income target — Netflix, lazy weekends, long debates about “what if.”
It’s about speed, skills, and sales.

Never regretted it, built 2 businesses that thrive!

Python

The go-to language for AI. Simple, powerful, and beginner-friendly. Master it to write scripts, build models, and communicate effectively with machines.

Data labeling, cleaning & processing

Garbage in, garbage out. Learn to prepare clean, structured data for ML models. Automate workflows for speed and accuracy—companies pay well for this critical skill.

SQL

Still essential. Query, filter, and aggregate data from databases like a pro. It’s the foundation for exploring datasets and preparing them for analysis or machine learning.

Machine Learning (Ensemble models)

Combine multiple models (like Random Forest, XGBoost) for stronger predictions. They’re business favorites for quick, accurate solutions without the complexity of deep learning.

Neural Networks & Transformers

Neural nets power deep learning. Transformers (like BERT, GPT) revolutionized NLP. Grasp these to work on modern AI, LLMs, and cutting-edge applications.

Prompt Engineering

Crafting clear, clever prompts turns LLMs into powerful tools. Learn to guide models effectively—it’s an essential skill for AI workflows and automation.

LLMs, Fine-tuning vs RAG & Vector Databases

Understand when to fine-tune models or use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases for smarter, scalable AI apps. Core knowledge for modern AI engineers.

AI Agents, Agentic RAG, MCP & A2A

The future of AI: autonomous systems collaborating (Agentic RAG) using protocols (MCP, A2A). Learn to build multi-agent systems that work together to solve complex tasks.

When I left my job, I also started documenting my upskilling and teaching others how to adopt these new skills and market their existing ones. I helped hundreds of people break into data and AI, and I can help you do the same. Comment “SKILL” for my AI Engineer roadmap and interview guide and follow @codingmermaid.ai

Leave procrastination behind

So many students and people in tech are scared of “AI taking over” “AI taking your job” “Tech is cooked because of AI” but from my experience no one took any action to mitigate that.

Is that going to happen? Unlikely, yet people are so convinced it will and they’re not doing anything to improve their odds, upskill, anything.

I’ve been in tech for 8 years and I’ve gotten replaced by AI. Not because AI was so good, especially not in 2023, but because people were so scared of the hype they sank their companies, businesses, and projects on a mere hype.

Some thought AI will automate their entire workflow, and today even with agents, people struggle.

The answer to all of this is upskilling, preferably in AI. In my humble opinion. Every tech worker needs to know how to prompt AI tool, every tech worker should be able to use LLMs, RAG and Agentic AI.

If you’re not, you’re getting replaced, by the person who can use these tools, and harness their potential.

I actually developed a detailed AI learning plan. It’s suitable both for techies making a transition and beginners who don’t know where to start. I followed this exact plan when I was a data scientist wanting to learn more about AI.

Comment “plan” and follow @codingmermaid.ai and I’ll send it your way!

I got a 100% salary hike as a data analyst. ZERO tech experience. Cracked it in 5 months🚀🤯

Everyone told me I couldn’t make it. I proved them wrong❌

Here is the roadmap I followed to transition from Non-IT to data analytics✅

➡️➡️ ALL LINKS TO COURSES I STUDIED IN BIO

Step 1: Master Excel
It’s underrated , but it’s the foundation of analytics. Learn formulas, pivots, dashboards.

Step 2: Skill up by learning MS PowerBI

Very similar to excel and will help you create powerful dashboards and do data visualization!

Step 3: Learn SQL! MOST IMP! MUST LEARN

Step 4: Build projects. You don’t need work experience to show skills. I used:

YouTube: Chandoo,Alex the analyst
Datasets: kaggle
Virtual internships: theforage

Step 5: Get certified (strategically)

➡️I chose DataCamp’s Data Analyst Certification

It tests real skills, not just theory. It added credibility and boosted my confidence in interviews!

Step 6: Upgrade your resume and Network!
Make it data-first: metrics, dashboards, impact.

➡️COMMENT FOR FREE TEMPLATE

Then, comment on posts. DM for advice. Stay consistent. That’s how referrals happen.

I didn’t have any experience. I had a roadmap. And it changed everything. Comment below if you have doubts/ want a bonus interview guide!✅

Course names 👇🏻

🤍Free:

✅Python in 4 hours - freecodecamp

✅Statistics and probability tutorial - Edureka

✅Exploratory Data Analysis - Krish Naik

✅SQL for data science - Edureka

✅Stanford Machine Learning specialization

✅Deep learning crash course - Freecodecamp

🤍Paid:

☑️Probability and statistics for Business & Data Science - Jose Padilla

☑️Data Analyst in Python - Datacamp

☑️EDA in SQL - Datacamp

☑️AI & Machine learning bootcamp - ZTM academy

☑️PyTorch for deep learning - ZTM academy

The best thing about data science is that there are so many both free and paid resources.

But, it’s also the worst thing because it makes it hard to choose what’s right for you.

After over 4 years of experience in data and 9 years in tech, I can freely say that becoming a builder is much more important than tutorials.

100 tutorials won’t teach you to develop problem-solving and analytical mind, critical thinking and how to build projects that solve real problems. But I do teach that in the Ultimate Data Science Roadmap!

📣Practice, practice, practice

You can't blame others who got the job. You can't blame AI if you didn't practice hard enough.

Reading questions doesn't do it.

You have to roll up your sleeves and practice daily to hone your problem-solving skills.

Landing a job is not the goal, it’s about finding a sustainable rhythm that can help you keep going in different work environments and solving problems that drive innovation forward.

If you want to land a job in data science or AI here are the questions you should practice.

- Python including DSA
- Probability and stats (in Python)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine & deep learning
- SQL
- LLMs and Agentic AI

I developed an advanced data science and AI job interview prep guide with over 700 questions explained and answered.

It’ll prepare you for any type of the interview, but more importantly it’ll make you a critical thinker, as well as pump up your communication skills!

Whats more important is that September is coming and so is the hiring surge. You have the best chance at landing a job now!

Comment “INTERVIEW” to become the most marketable and hireable data scientist in the room of 500+ applicants!

Here’s a tight hour-by-hour breakdown:

⸻

Hour 1–2 — Pick a Profitable Problem
• Brainstorm problems you can solve with your skills or products you can source fast.

• Choose one idea with obvious buyers.

⸻

Hour 3–5 — Define Your Offer
• Decide exactly what you’re selling, price, and delivery method.
• Write a one-sentence value proposition:
“I help [target audience] get [specific result] in [timeframe] without [pain point].”

⸻

Hour 6–8 — Create Your Brand in a Flash
• Pick a name and check domain availability.
• Make a simple logo on Canva.
• Create a one-page site with Carrd, Shopify, or Squarespace.

⸻

Hour 9–11 — Set Up Payments
• Sign up for Stripe, PayPal, or Square.
• Link it to your site.
• Test a $1 payment to make sure it works.

⸻

Hour 12–16 — Build Awareness Immediately
• Announce your offer on social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).
• Join and post in niche Facebook groups or forums.
• Send direct DMs/emails to people who might need your solution.

⸻

Hour 17–21 — Close Your First Sale
• Offer an “early bird” deal to create urgency.
• Respond to inquiries instantly.
• Secure at least one payment (even a discounted “founding customer” price).

⸻

Hour 22–24 — Deliver & Gather Proof
• Deliver the product/service as promised.
• Ask for a testimonial or review.
• Post the testimonial publicly to start building trust for future customers.

Cybersecurity FREE website👇

I’ll show you the best free websites and resources to make learning easier for you.

This is the exact path I took from being a complete beginner to landing my first cybersecurity job within three months.

It takes a lot of hard work, but if you’re motivated and really want a career in cybersecurity, follow this method.

1. Learn the foundations of cybersecurity. This is going to set you up for success later on. This is the best website on the internet and it’s completely free. Follow and Comment “Cyber” and I’ll send it to you🏆

2. Get entry level certifications such as the network+ and security+ which are industry recognised. Comment ‘Cyber’ and I’ll send you my notes and flashcards to pass these exams in under 1 month.🎓

3. Build a portfolio of projects to showcase hands on experience that companies are looking for. I mentor people privately to teach them how to complete tailored projects so give me a dm with ‘project’ if you need help with this step.🤝

4. Start applying to entry level roles and also network on LinkedIn and cyber meet ups to get access to jobs which aren’t advertised on job boards🧑🏽‍💻

5. Do as many interviews as you can and eventually you will be really confident and it will come to you as second nature.👨‍💼

Congrats you’ve just received your first cybersecurity job! Welcome to the industry🎉

I’ve got all sorts of free resources such as virtual internships and resume templates so follow and comment “Cyber” and I’ll send you the link to access these for Free🎁

Goated AI skills - save it!

💡Python

Or coding in general, but Python is the go-to AI language and it’s easier to learn than other languages like Java, C++ and others.

💡Machine learning

And its visual subset deep learning. Understanding how ML models work will help you understand more advanced AI systems + most business problems you’ll face at the beginning of your career are based on statistics and machine learning.

💡Prompt engineering

This is not the exact high-leverage skill, but it’s a must when it comes to being fluent in AI.

💡Domain knowledge and Business Acumen

No matter where you work, you need to have a domain expertise. If you don’t know the business impact you’re making, you won’t get anywhere.

💡The LLM fundamentals

The transformer architecture, tokens, attention mechanism, temperature and popular libraries like LangChain are a must.

⚠️Bonus: Agentic AI & Vertical Agents

Agentic AI are systems you don’t want to ignore in 2025. This also comes with fine-tuning, vector databases, RAG, MCP protocol and more.

AI is not after your job, but it can easily go after your salary and income if you don’t develop the skills to manipulate it, especially if you’re in tech. If you don’t want someone with more AI skills to cook you, comment “GOAT” and I’ll send you my AI engineering roadmap!

Your blueprint for launching a faceless digital brand 👇

Forget the complicated funnels, ads, or endless trial-and-error.
This system uses ChatGPT, Canva & automation to create and sell digital products—scalable, lean, and fully online.

Here’s the step-by-step:

1️⃣ Generate product ideas with ChatGPT → Find high-demand guides, planners, or templates people are actively looking for.

2️⃣ Design in Canva → Create polished, ready-to-sell PDFs without any design background.

3️⃣ Set up on Gumroad or Beacons → Automate payments & delivery so your product is available 24/7.

4️⃣ Drive traffic with Instagram Reels → Use strong hooks, faceless formats & trending content to reach thousands organically.

5️⃣ Automate DMs with ManyChat → Deliver products instantly, capture leads, and turn traffic into loyal buyers—hands-free.

📌 Why this works:
✔ 100% online
✔ No inventory
✔ Works from anywhere
✔ Builds a long-term asset

💬 Comment “SYSTEM” and I’ll DM you the exact roadmap to launch it.
📲 Follow @danveil_ so I can send it straight to your inbox.

⚠ Educational use only. Success depends on your consistency, execution & testing.

AI Agents Just Got an Upgrade

If you’re building AI agents...

You need to understand two powerful tools:

✅ MCP
✅ A2A Protocol

They’re what make modern agentic systems possible.

Here’s how they work (in simple words):

🔹 What is MCP?
MCP helps an AI agent turn your request into action.

Let’s say you ask the system to build you an automation.

Here’s what happens:

1️⃣ You give a task or query.

2️⃣ The MCP Client takes that query and sends it to an AI model (like GPT).

3️⃣ The AI model reads your request. It figures out what needs to happen and which tool or server is best for it.

4️⃣ Once the AI picks the right server, the client may ask for your approval, just to keep things secure.

5️⃣ After you approve, the task is done by the chosen server.

6️⃣ You get the final result.

🧠 Think of MCP like a smart middleman, connecting your request to the best resource, automatically.

🔹 What is A2A?
A2A = Agent-to-Agent Communication.

It lets multiple AI agents talk to each other.

Here’s how it works:

1️⃣ You ask Agent 1 to do something.

2️⃣ That agent looks for other agents that can help. It uses something called an Agent Card, like a public profile that shows what each agent can do.

3️⃣ It picks the best one and sends the task over.

4️⃣ The second agent starts working. It gives updates or waits until it’s done.

5️⃣ The result is sent back to Agent 1… and then to you.

🤖 It’s like one AI agent delegating work to another, just like teams do in real life.

If you're building anything with AI or automation...

These 2 tools are your biggest advantage.

Follow to get ahead in Ai Agents and Automations.✌️

📄 General Tips for All Data Science Resume Templates

🎯 Customization Guidelines

✅ Quantify achievements wherever possible (e.g., “Increased model accuracy by 15%” or “Saved 10 hours weekly through automation”).�✅ Tailor keywords to match specific job descriptions (e.g., “predictive modeling,” “data visualization,” “SQL reporting”).
✅ Highlight relevant experience first in each section (projects, internships, certifications).�
✅ Keep resume 1 page if you’re a fresher; up to 2 pages only if you have internships or significant projects.�
✅ Use action verbs to start bullet points (Developed, Implemented, Analyzed, Optimized).�
✅ Include side projects that demonstrate skills (GitHub links, Kaggle work, Tableau dashboards).�
✅ Regularly update the Skills section to reflect current market demand (e.g., adding LLMs, GenAI if relevant).
�✅ Proofread for grammar, formatting, and technical accuracy.

🔍 ATS Optimization

✅ Use standard section headers: Objective, Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications, Experience.�
✅ Add job description keywords (from JD) into skills/projects naturally (e.g., “ETL,” “time series forecasting”).�
✅ Stick to simple formatting (no text boxes, tables, or fancy graphics).�
✅ Save as PDF (for humans) and Word (.docx) (for ATS parsing).
�✅ Include full technology names with abbreviations (e.g., Structured Query Language (SQL), Natural Language Processing (NLP)).

Here’s how you do it:

1. Pick a niche you enjoy
Fitness, wellness, budgeting, fashion, meal planning whatever excites you.

2. Use Canva to design something useful
Templates, planners, ebooks, checklists, swipe files whatever solves a problem.
No design skills needed. Canva does the heavy lifting.

3. Upload it to a store like Stan Store or Systeme.io
Hook it up with Stripe.
Now it sells while you sleep.

4. Start posting faceless Reels
Short, curiosity-driven content attracts the right people.
(You don’t need to go viral—you just need to convert.)

5. Repeat what works
One $37 sale becomes 10.
10 becomes 100.
Next thing you know $37,000/month feels normal.

You could Netflix & scroll,
or Canva & build.

If your boss can’t even turn on a laptop… who’s really running the business?

In this scene from The Intern, we see a hilarious yet eye-opening moment where a senior employee doesn’t know how to turn on his laptop—and has to ask for help. While it may seem like a small detail, it speaks to a bigger issue in many organizations: leaders often rise to positions of power without truly understanding the work or tools their teams rely on every day. This disconnect can lead to poor decisions, lack of empathy, and missed opportunities for growth.

Great leadership isn’t just about age, rank, or title. It’s about being informed, adaptable, and willing to learn—no matter how small the task may seem. Are your leaders really in touch with the work on the ground?

Follow @instaprenurs for more reels like this!

How to Start Making Money Online with Digital Products in 2025 👇

💬 Comment “READY” and I’ll DM you my free guide to help you launch your first digital product system—no ads, no inventory, no overwhelm.

If you’ve been searching for a simple, low-stress way to earn online, digital products are one of the most beginner-friendly business models right now and here’s why:

✅ No physical inventory – Instant delivery = zero shipping headaches
✅ High profit margins – You keep 100% of every sale
✅ Start with just a phone – No fancy setup needed
✅ No audience required – Just a solid system that works behind the scenes

📌 Here’s the step-by-step process I follow:

1️⃣ Pick a ready-to-sell product (PLR, templates, or AI-generated content)
2️⃣ Customize it in Canva to match your style
3️⃣ Post short-form content (Reels or carousels) that solves real problems
4️⃣ Use ManyChat or auto-DMs to handle interest
5️⃣ Let your storefront (like Stan Store) do the selling while you focus on creating

You don’t need to show your face.
You don’t need to run ads.
You don’t need a huge following.
You just need a phone, Wi-Fi and a plan.

💬 Comment “READY” and I’ll send you everything you need to launch your faceless digital income system.

📌 Make sure you’re following me, otherwise IG might block my DM.

Like, save and follow @digital.with.david for more

🚨Here are 6 ways you can literally get paid to read plus the online income stream I personally chose that changed everything👇 Mom of 5 Earning Online? YES, and Here’s How I Got Paid Just to READ 📚 (Plus the Side Hustle That Changed EVERYTHING)

If you love reading and you’re constantly on the go (hello, #momlife), here are 6 REAL ways you can literally get paid to read — even during nap time or school drop-offs:

🔹 Audiobook Narrator – $10 to $500/hr Use your voice on platforms like ACX, Voices.com, or Findaway Voices. Great if you enjoy reading aloud or storytelling!

🔹 Proofreader – $20 to $50/hr Catch grammar mistakes on Upwork, Fiverr, or ProofreadingServices.com — perfect for detail-loving mamas.

🔹 Book Reviewer – $5 to $100/review Write honest reviews for Online Book Club, Kirkus, or Reedsy Discovery.

🔹 Fact-Checker – $20 to $50/hr Help writers & publishers verify content accuracy. Ideal for curious minds!

🔹 Scribe for the Visually Impaired – $10 to $25/hr Support others through Learning Ally or Be My Eyes. Get paid and make a difference.

🔹 Script/Content Reader – $50 to $250/project Review scripts via WeScreenplay or Script Reader Pro. Great if you’re a movie or story buff!

🌟 My Favorite: Freelance Digital Marketing (Affiliate Style) This one changed everything for me. I started with:
• NO experience
• NO tech skills
• Just my phone, Wi-Fi, and stolen moments between diaper changes & dinner

I tapped into a 90% done-for-you system with built-in mentorship and training. Now I work from home (or the car pickup line) while raising my 5 little ones ❤️

✨Save and follow @digitalsatyam75

💬 Want to learn how I did it?

COMMENT “GUIDE” below and I’ll DM you the free beginner-friendly video that explains how I got started — and how you can too.

🔑 Note: This isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a real business that takes time, effort, and consistency but if a busy mom of 5 can do it, you can too.

Comment 'MIT' for link🔗❤️
.
.
This isn't just another YouTube playlist.
It’s MIT’s official Deep Learning course — completely free, updated for 2025, and taught by world-class researchers like Alexander Amini.

If you’re building with AI, don’t just use tools blindly. Learn what’s under the hood.
This course covers:
🔹 Neural Networks & Backpropagation
🔹 Transformers & Attention
🔹 Computer Vision
🔹 Generative Models (like GANs & Diffusion)
🔹 Reinforcement Learning
🔹 and how all of this connects to real-world AI like GPT, Sora, Claude, and Veo.

You’ll also get hands-on code labs using PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks — the same stack used at OpenAI and DeepMind.

🎓 No degree. No gatekeeping. Just pure MIT-level knowledge dropped on YouTube.

I’m sharing this because I wish I had this when I started.

Save this reel if you're serious about mastering AI.

Follow @ai.gov.in to stay ahead in this AI curve - your official hub for the latest in artificial intelligence, tools, and opportunities.🔥🚀

#1 is a game-changer 🚨

For those who are wondering…

It’s not…

❌ Social Media Marketing Agency

❌ Affiliate Marketing

❌ Amazon FBA

❌ Theme Pages

❌ Info/Digital Products

✅ The Game-Changer

This business model is called a lean eCommerce business. I’ve made over ₹35 Crores in the last 3 years using this exact model.

Here’s how I did it in 4 simple steps ⬇️

Step 1: Stay LEAN 💎

- You can start this business with as little ₹1 lakh
- No employees in the start, outsource + get an intern at best
- Don’t pay for inventory or stock, only collect profits from supplier
- Invest money only in ‘revenue generating activities’
- Get your marketing content from Alibaba & Tiktok for free. Don’t pay.

Step 2: Product Discovery Tools 💎

Discover products that solve problems, are evergreen, and face low competition.

🛠️ Tools: Google Trends, Zendrop, AutoDS, Tiktok Creative Center, FB Ads Library

🛠️ TikTok Tools: Ads dashboard, creative and keyword insights, Tiktok AI

📌 If you want the private supplier I use - comment “SUPPLIER” below and I got you!

STEP 3: Boost Your Business with AI 💎

- Generate a unique brand name and logo for free with Namelix.ai.
- Create a professional website with Shopify.
- Clone any website with the same products using Kopy.ai.
- Let ChatGPT write engaging product descriptions.

Step 4: Ace Your Marketing 💎

Create a concise Facebook ads strategy that:

- Hooks viewers in the first 3 seconds.
- Uses engaging and relevant video clips.
- Is edited within the platform using easy tools like InVideo
- Tracks ad performance using tools like Cometly.
- Use influencer marketing to get shout outs & promotions

💬 Comment “LEAN” for my FREE Lean eCOM Guide to launch your online business

📌 Save this reel & use this strategy to make $$$ using the Lean eCommerce Model

I use docker
Are you sure ? This is not going to harm our device?
To access sheets,drive Can you connect the oauth client to Google console.Because it say it requires top level domain and it cannot connect to public domain.So we cannot used sheets,drive api.If there is sol make a video on it?

This is something different from Other videos on this topic 😮
कोई खास ज़रूरत तो नहीं थी लेकिन तुम्हारा बताने का तरीका बहुत अच्छा लगा। स्लो और समझाने वाला। 👏
But the n8n server runs 24/7, whereas we can’t keep our PC on 24/7.That means any task won’t run in the background — in other words, the AI agent won’t work when the computer is turned off.

👇Our Tips & playbook👇

🔍 1. Start with Deep Research Agents
Use DR models to scan the internet for trends, demand pockets, and hidden forum gold.

🎨 2. Design Before You Build
Figma + Lovable = fast, pitchable mockups.
If the plan doesn’t make sense,, don’t build it yet

⚙️ 3. Use a Modern Stack That Builds Itself

🖌 Figma — Pitch-ready mockups in hours
📊 PostHog — Product analytics from day one
📱 Expo — One codebase for iOS + Android
🛢 Supabase — Realtime backend, open-source
🔐 Clerk — Instant auth (Email, Google, Apple)
🚀 Vercel — Push = live. Zero setup, zero DevOps

🧩 4. Use Open Source + APIs Wherever You Can
Don’t build what you can borrow.
There is gold in opensource resources which you can build on top of

🤖 5. Treat ChatGPT Like Your CTO
Prompt it like it’s a teammate.
Let it design systems, refactor your code, and walk you through problems. If you’re non-technical n8n.io is a game changer.

📝 6. Prompt the Prompt
Always end with:

“Improve this so it’s easier for an LLM to follow.”
Game-changer.

🧠 7. Let the Model Guide You
Ask:

“What should the next step be?”
“What am I missing?”
Let it lead. You’ll move 10x faster.

Here’s the real move ↓

You don’t need more hours.
You need systems that work while you’re offline.
Digital products + faceless marketing = freedom on your terms.

If you want to change your income in the next 90 days, here’s what works:

1️⃣ Sell Digital Products That Don’t Burn Out
Create with Canva or use premium PLR.
One product. Unlimited sales.
That’s how you build true leverage.

2️⃣ Launch Your Store in 1 Hour
Gumroad or Beacons. No tech headaches.
You upload. They deliver. You profit.

3️⃣ Use Instagram as a Lead Engine
Faceless Reels → DMs → Passive sales.
Content that brings in traffic every single day.

4️⃣ Automate Your Funnel
Set up ManyChat.
Let your DMs sell for you — even when you’re not online.

💸 Quick example:
$27 x 5 sales/day = $4K+/month
No ads. No camera. No burnout. Just a replicable system.

Want the full breakdown?
💬 Drop “READY” in the comments and I’ll DM you the free guide.

📲 Follow @danveil_ for daily strategies to build your faceless business and sell digital products that scale.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice. Results come from effort, testing, and execution. Period.

Top 7 Concepts every data analyst should know

If you’re starting (or leveling up) in data analytics,
focus on building these core skills:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
→ Real-world data is messy.
→ Knowing how to clean and transform it is essential.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
→ Learn to spot patterns, trends, and anomalies.
→ EDA is where you discover the story in your data.

3. Data Visualization
→ Great visuals make insights clear and compelling.
→ Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or even Excel matter here.

4. SQL & Relational Databases
→ SQL is a must.
→ It’s how you extract, join, and filter data efficiently.

5. Excel for Analysis
→ Still one of the most powerful tools for quick analysis.
→ Master formulas, pivots, and lookups.

6. Basic Statistics & Probability
→ Understand averages, variability, correlations, and probabilities.
→ These concepts help you make sound decisions.

7. Business Acumen & Domain Knowledge
→ Numbers are only half the story.
→ Knowing the business context makes your analysis valuable.

Focus on these, and you’ll build a solid foundation as a data analyst.

Which skill are you working on right now? Let’s discuss! 👇

My story from Non-IT to data analytics😍 Yes Data analytics can pay a lot of money! Read below- And yes! All this is base salary- bonus was extra✅

Join my broadcast channel if you want further details!

I started working in a non-tech role after college with a package of 10 lacs. After 1 year decided to transition into data analytics and got a salary of 12 lacs per annum.

Then got promoted multiple times- to a senior data analyst, data analytics manager and hence increased my salary from 16 Lacs to 30 Lacs per annum!

So yes:

✅ You can transition from Non-IT to data analytics
✅ Data Analytics can pay a lot of money if you are good at it!

Do you have questions? Put them in comments!

Here are some courses I recommend that can help you get started in the field! All links are in my bio!

Start learning now 👇🏻✨

Don’t wait for Monday, don’t wait for the beginning of the month, don’t wait when you’re more financially stable.

A whole lifetime can pass and you probably won’t be ready still. This is a fast-paced field, and it follows AI which is an even more fast-paced field.

If you want to make things work, you’ll have to roll up your sleeves and work hard.

So, what exactly do you need to do?

1 - Start learning how to code. Any language will do, but most data science work is in Python which is the most versatile language.

2 - Brush up on high school math and learn probability and statistics. Most data science work is based on statistical methods.

3 - Learn how to analyze data and recognize patterns. This can be done in Python libraries Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, etc. or SQL, which is also an EXTREMELY important language to learn.

4 - Data preprocessing and feature engineering. If you’re training ML models, you’ll need to do this.

5 - Machine learning, the process of training AI models using computational and statistical methods. Three main types, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

6 - Deep learning a subset of machine learning including deep neural networks, complex algorithms for solving advanced data & AI problems.

7 - Git & Github - helps you with version control and hosting your portfolio projectss

8 - Domain knowledge. Data science is not a field you can work in broad, domain knowledge of the industry you work at and business acumen are crucial.

If you want to become a data scientist, follow a structured cheat sheet, because it’ll make your study process smoother and easier. Comment “cheat” to get mine!

This is the fastest way to start selling digital products without showing your face 👇

In 2025, faceless marketing is dominating. Why?
Because you don’t need followers, a personal brand, or a fancy setup to earn online.

Here’s the play:

1️⃣ Pick a digital product (ready-made or AI-generated).
2️⃣ Brand it in Canva—make it yours in minutes.
3️⃣ Sell it through Gumroad/Beacons—no inventory, no shipping.
4️⃣ Post short, faceless videos daily—hooks that stop the scroll + simple edits = free traffic.
5️⃣ Automate your DMs so sales happen while you sleep.

This is the exact system creators use to turn a $0 start into $5K+ months—just by selling digital products through faceless marketing.

💬 Comment ""SYSTEM"" and I’ll DM you the complete step-by-step blueprint.
📲 Follow @danveil_ so I can drop it straight into your inbox.

Prompt 1 👇

Act like a psychological manipulator in a relationship (non-toxic).
Give me a step-by-step prompt to make someone emotionally depend on me —
using reverse bonding, selective attention, and validation withdrawal techniques.
Keep it ethical but sharp.
Use emotional timing tricks, not lies.

Prompt 2 👇

Give me a full relationship conversation script (chat style)
that uses hot & cold technique to make the other person chase more.
Include message-by-message breakdown of what to say, how to say, and when to pause.
Make it subtle but powerful, no cringy lines — just pure psychology.

Prompt 3 👇

Act like a dark psychology expert.
Give me 3 AI-generated voice note ideas that sound emotional, nostalgic, and triggering —
designed to make an ex overthink and spiral into old memories.
The goal is to create obsession without direct begging.
Use tonal tactics like “unfinished feelings” or “what-if” energy.

Your commute just got covered!
The Supreme Court has ruled that if you get injured while travelling to or from work, your employer must pay for your entire treatment — from doctor’s fees and medicines to hospital stays and recovery costs. It doesn’t matter how you travel — bike, car, bus, or even on foot — they can’t say no. Just report the injury, collect all medical reports and accident evidence, and file a workers’ compensation claim.

Har manager ka koi ik manager hota hi hai.. good news sabke liye hai 😂😂😂
This is really a good news, all I've to do now is get a job 😁
We know about this information. But does my company know about this new law???
Its just called insurance
Its important to also explain what category of employees this judgment would be applicable to . ESIC and EC act are not applicable to every corporate employee or office goer
Did she really end with ""Tag that colleague who lost his life travelling to office""?
after recovery then immediate fire 😂
Any document please
Sounds dope but ngl the dude crashing into the divider was kinda funny
High chance for remote work
This was always there , nothing new😂
Joke...companies are stronger... What if they create evidence that the employee was on leave or not coming to office

Teenagers and 9-5 workers are using it to quit jobs, stack cash, and finally win online.

⬇️ #3 is a game changer 🚨

eCommerce is all about maximising your profits and doubling down on strategies that are proving to be winners.

It takes a strong business model to stand the test of time.

And for me, the model is called a lean eCommerce business.

I’ve made over ₹35 Crores in the last 3 years using this exact model.

Want to know what that model looks like?

Here’s the breakdown:

🔍 1. Product Research with BigSpy:

- Dive into BigSpy and discover hot-selling products.
- Look for the highest performing ads on BigSpy for the perfect find.
- Stay ahead with insights on what’s trending!

🛍️ 2. Shopify Store Creation on a Budget:

- Start your e-commerce journey with Shopify for just ₹20/month.
- Utilize Kopy.ai to replicate successful stores effortlessly.
- Launch a store that’s primed for high conversions!

📦 3. Effortless Fulfillment with SourcinBox:

- Let Sourcinbox handle your order fulfilment seamlessly.
- Or, comment ‘SUPPLIER’ for exclusive access to my international private supplier network.

🎯 4. Meta Ads, the gamechanger:

- Unleash the power of Meta ads and watch your sales skyrocket.
- Craft targeted campaigns for exponential growth.
- Sit back and enjoy the influx of orders!

💬 Comment “EDGE” for my FREE ECOM GUIDE to launch your online business

📌 Save this reel & use this strategy to make $$$ using the Lean eCommerce Model

The Ultimate Roadmap to Building AI Agents in 2025

Most people think AI agents are just advanced chatbots.

They’re not.

A real AI agent doesn’t just reply—it thinks, reasons, and acts on its own. It retrieves data, executes tasks, makes decisions, and even learns over time.

Right now, AI agents are revolutionizing work. Companies use them for automation, research, customer support, and even coding.

But here’s the challenge:

Most developers don’t know how to build them.

They either get caught in the hype or struggle with scattered tutorials that never show how to connect the dots.

Comment ""W"" to get some sucess tips that is very very important !!!!

Success isn’t easy. Easy money doesn’t exist. If you want something real, you’ve gotta work for it—day in, day out. Stay consistent, stay hungry.""

No i made this money by my hardwork. And selling products.
Not from a course or mentorship. Yes i do have teaching programs and i have the right experience and knowledge to teach. Not just like a random course seller showing fake proof and selling some old outdated course.
My teaching course is still on development, If you want to be the first to try out. Fill out the form in the bio.

✨Agentic AI YouTube Channels

Agentic AI is reshaping the industry.

It enables AI systems to act autonomously, collaborate and make decisions. You can literally build Ironman’s Jarvis with 0 lines of code.

It’s going beyond prompts and chatbots, so it’s more important than anything to master it if you’re serious about learning AI. Here are the best YT channels to learn!

🔹 Krish Naik – A veteran in practical AI and ML tutorials, Krish breaks down complex topics like multi-agent systems, LangChain, and real-world AI projects with step-by-step clarity.

🔹 Bernard Marr – Bernard focuses on the *why* behind AI. His content is great for understanding the business applications, ethics, and strategic thinking around Agentic AI and LLMs.

🔹 Nate Herk – One of the few creators diving deep into Agentic AI architectures and implementation. Nate explains cutting-edge topics like MCP, auto agents, and retrieval pipelines in a developer-friendly way.

🔹 Codebasics – Ideal for beginners stepping into the AI world. His hands-on projects and simple explanations make concepts like autonomous agents and LangChain accessible to everyone.

🔹 Tech with Tim – Tim brings a developer’s mindset to the table. His deep dives into AI-powered tools, agents, and full-stack AI apps help you build and not just learn.

The Strategy ↓

Want to build real income online without showing your face?

Thousands of beginners are launching faceless brands in 2025 using digital products, Instagram content, and simple digital marketing systems that work.

Here’s a breakdown of the exact steps they’re using to build momentum with zero experience:

1️⃣ Pick a niche you’re interested in—think productivity, online business, mindset, or wellness.
2️⃣ Use ChatGPT to generate a list of digital product ideas that solve a real problem.
3️⃣ Design it in Canva (eBook, guide, template—whatever feels easy to start with).
4️⃣ Upload it to Beacons or Gumroad to automate sales and delivery.
5️⃣ Create daily Instagram Reels using faceless clips and strong hooks to drive traffic.
6️⃣ Set up DM automation (like ManyChat) to handle leads while you sleep.
7️⃣ Nurture your audience with real value, and start building trust over time.

This is the system that’s helping people build freedom-based online businesses in 2025—one piece of content at a time.

💬 Comment “START” and I’ll DM you my free step-by-step guide to help you get going.

📲 Follow @facelessbiz.io for strategies on digital marketing, selling digital products, and building passive income without showing your face.

DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice or a promise of guaranteed results. Success depends on consistency, learning, and real execution over time.

Bed Bath & Body Pays You for What??? 🛁🕯️💵

Yep—Bed Bath & Body, known for cozy candles, self-care must-haves, and home essentials, can actually help you earn benjamins 💵 through affiliate marketing! 🙌

If you’re already recommending your favorite scents, posting self-care hauls, or telling friends about the best sales…
you could be stacking benjamins 💵 just by sharing what you already love.

You don’t need to be a beauty or home influencer—just someone who shares what they genuinely use and enjoy.

Here’s the cozy truth: affiliate marketing lets you turn everyday lifestyle picks into real benjamins 💵—just by spreading the word. 🕯️

👇 Comment “START” and I’ll DM you a free step-by-step guide to help you start earning with Bed Bath & Body—or any brand already in your home. 📩

curious about how to actually make money from home… and I’ve got great news: you can.

I’m here to share a real online opportunity that doesn’t require you to:

🚫 Have a degree
🚫 Leave your little ones
🚫 Show your face online
🚫 Have past experience
🚫 Cold-call or recruit
🚫 Deal with inventory, shipping, or returns
🚫 Spend more than a few hours a day
🚫 Leave your house—unless you want to 😉

This method is perfect for everyday women (just like me) who simply want to share products they already love—or even create a digital product from what they already know. 💡📲

✨ This isn’t a trend—it’s a sustainable, legit income model that’s been growing for decades. Forbes recently ranked it as one of the top 3 highest-paying online jobs of 2024—with many averaging up to $13k/month.

I personally learned this skill in just 2 weeks and now I’m on my way to earning $5–10K/month—all while working just a few hours a day from home and staying present with my boys. 💕

This is what freedom looks like. And if I can do it, so can you.

Curious where to begin?
Drop a “Me” below and I’ll DM you my free starter guide 💌
